What does this glossary intend to facilitate/do?
This glossary provides a one-stop resource for all the internal acronyms and terminology an employee will encounter in their time on the Wellcome Genome Campus. It aims to bridge the gap in WGC-specific knowledge between new starters and older employees far faster. 

Who is this glossary intended to help?
The glossary is designed for use by those who feel a little lost in all the acronyms and terminology that one is bombarded with on campus. It can also be used by those who just wish to learn a little more about the organisations present on campus. 

What can users find here?
The full name and definitions of acronyms and terms found internally on the campus, as well as external/internal links to websites detailing more information. 

What is the relation of this glossary to others (good spot to list/link to other resources)?
The Helix Intranet and Train Online glossaries also contain a lot of the terminology and information that could be desired by an employee. Helix contains a lot of admin and organisational information whereas Train Online focuses on high level science and computing definitions.  This glossary focuses on the acronyms and terms that tend to be a little harder to gain information on. Links between resources will be available if another is more suitable for the query.
